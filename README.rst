 Network Coding Kernel Library
===============================

Description
===========

This library contains encoders and decoders that can be used for network coded
communications. The encoders and decoders implement different protocols so that
the user only has to feed them with data and transmit the generated packets.

See docs/quickstart.rst for instructions how to get started.
